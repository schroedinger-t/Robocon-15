# Robocon-15
Codes for Remotely operated Badminton Robots

Robocon is a Pan-Asia Robotics Competition. As part of Team Robocon, BITS Goa we developed two remotely operated Badminton Robots. We used Arduino Mega to accomplish this. The robots were wirelessly controlled. interfaced using a modified PS2 Controller and HC05 Bluetooth module. The problem statement was to manufacture two Badminton Robots to play a doubles match against the opponent team. One robot should act as the serving robot and should be able to serve from a specified distance from the net. The other receiving robot has to be place in the other half.

This repo contains the Arduino code for the Serving Robot and the Receiving Robot.
